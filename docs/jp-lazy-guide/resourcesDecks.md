    - On `Anki`: `Browse` > `Under Decks`, click `漢字 Writing` > `Click on a card` then `Ctrl + A` or `select everything`
    - On `Toolbar`: `Notes` > `Find and Replace`
        Find: `<u>(?P<t>.*?)</u>`
        Replace With: `<b>$t</b>`
        In: `SentenceBack` and `SentenceFront`
        Selected notes only: `Checked`

        Treat input as a regular expression: `Checked`
    - Apply it and it should be good
