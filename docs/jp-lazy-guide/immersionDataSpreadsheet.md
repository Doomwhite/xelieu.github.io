# Immersion Data Spreadsheet

This is a very `detailed spreadsheet` made in `GSheet`

- Can be used up until `2035`, until the `Sheet` page limit can no longer go beyond

## Setting up

!!! note "Immersion Data Spreadsheet up to 2035"

    [Clean Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CYJTt-BikDSH9FaSCOEPrzQk-jotcfhPr-lRxfqMfiU/edit?usp=sharing) | [Sample Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rD4kg2blrr0Sn9P6W6sRZy0sYzGp-Pv1VhGOKT7hgmA/edit?usp=sharing)

2. To copy, open the `Spreadsheet` then `File` > `Make a Copy`
    - To use other Sheets: go to `View` > `Hidden Sheets`
        - You can also `hide any sheet` to look clean as long as you don't delete them

3. (Optional) On your `Spreadsheet`, `Extensions` > `Add-ons` > `Get Add-ons` > `Bulk Sheet Manager`
    - Good for bulk hiding/unhiding sheets

## Extra Info and Tips

#### Info 1: Existing users updating from non-2035 version

??? info "Existing users updating from non-2035 version <small>(click here)</small>"

    - I recommend just copy pasting your data like this by copying the updated sheet, and replacing all the months with yours

        ![Spreadsheet Transfer](../img/spreadsheet-transfer.png){height=500 width=1000}

    - (This will take a LOT of time) OR copy and replace `Overall`, `Graph Tracker`, `Formula` and `Template Sheets` (View > Hidden Sheets)
        - `Make 2023-2035 sheets` of each month e.g. Jun-2024 (Format: Mon-YEAR)

#### Info 2: Updating the Spreadsheet yourself

At the time of writing, `2035` is the limit and already existing

??? info "Updating it Manually <small>(click here)</small>"

    - `You can update it yourself after the latest year` by just duplicating `Template sheet`(on Hidden Sheets)
    
    - Duplicate into `12 months of that year`, e.g. Jan-2023
        - (make sure its `3 letter per month` with capital on the first letter, Mon-YYYY)
    
    - Update formula in `Overall`, `Formula` and `Graph Tracker` sheet by adding the additional year on top of previous year
