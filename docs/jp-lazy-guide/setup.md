# Setup Introduction

If you are a fresh setup, please follow the guide from top to bottom as some of the guides are needed to be in chronological order.

This guide is a Hybrid Setup of [JP Mining Note](https://aquafina-water-bottle.github.io/jp-mining-note/), my Anki Add-ons, Yomichan and my tools settings

If you are coming from my old [Anki Mining Setup](https://rentry.co/lazyXel#anki), see [Transfer Lazy Setup to JPMN](https://xelieu.github.io/jp-lazy-guide/jp-lazy-guide/transferAnkiSetup/)
