# Setup: VN on Android

- You can play `Visual Novel` using an `Android` device running `Steam Link`
- Your `PC` must be running as the `Android` device will stream from your `PC`
- It still has all the features just as if you were in your `PC`

---

## Requirements

For `PC`:

- Running `Anki`, `Steam` and `Texthooker` page

For `Android`:

- Install and Run [Steam Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.valvesoftware.steamlink&hl=en_US)

!!! info "Note"

    `Visual Novel` doesn't have to be a steam game and `Steam Link` can run basically any games
