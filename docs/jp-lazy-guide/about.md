# About

I made the lazy guide because:

- Back then I just wanted a straightforward all-in-one source for all the latest tech towards setting up JP tools
    - Everything was scattered and was full of explanation though

- So I took the matters into my own hands and I've been maintaining the Lazy Guide for 2 years now
    - Updating whenever there's new tools and at most concise as I can
